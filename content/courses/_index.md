A key aim of the BES Quantitative Ecology Group is to support quantitative and computational skills development for all ecologists. To this end, we organise courses and share the materials here. 

We also have a community-contributed set of [guides for quantitative methods](http://qedoc.wikidot.com) under development. Feel free to share your input - see our [guidelines for contributing](http://qedoc.wikidot.com/wiki:how-to-contribute).

If you have any training needs which you think we could address, or have suggestions for courses you would like to see us organise (or would like to organise yourself with our support), please [contact us](/#contact).

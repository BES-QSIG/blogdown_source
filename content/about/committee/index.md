**Laura Graham** (Secretary)<br>
<span style="color:#b5b5b5">University of Southampton</span>

Laura is a spatial/computational ecologist who is interested in what impacts environmental changes have on species’ distributions and how we can use this information in landscape and conservation planning to reduce detrimental effects. In a previous career, Laura was a mathematician and database developer, and applies skills learned there to answer ecological questions.

**Gergana Daskalova** (Training and Education Rep / Online Resources Coordinator)<br>
<span style="color:#b5b5b5">University of Edinburgh</span>

Gergana is a global change ecologist with a passion for biodiversity change, agro-ecology and quantitative syntheses. The overarching aim of her research is to determine the sources of the complex patterns of population and biodiversity change observed over time around the world. From forest cover change around the world to climate warming in the Arctic and more, she is investigating how and why Earth’s biota is changing across the Anthropocene.

**Dominic Bennett** (Online Resources Coordinator)<br>
<span style="color:#b5b5b5">University of Gothenburg</span>

Dom did a PhD in macroevolution at Imperial College London and the Zoological Society of London on the legitimacy of the term “living fossil”. He now works as an open-source developer in phylogenetics and biodiversity informatics as part of a postdoctoral position at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden.

**Rick Stafford** (Ordinary Member)<br>
<span style="color:#b5b5b5">Bournemouth University</span>

Rick is a Principal Academic in Computational Ecology at Bournemouth University. His research involves the application of statistical and computational techniques to a wide variety of systems, particularly the structure of marine communities. Rick is interested in identification of novel biomarkers, and how these can be linked to changes in community structure; and also in the development of models with simple and intuitive interfaces, which can be used in topics as diverse as policy, management or education.

**Deputy Secretary**

We are looking for a Quantitative Ecologist to step into the deputy secretary role and provide some continuity to the SIG leadership. The deputy secretary role involves:

- Supporting the secretary in the running of the SIG - helping with budgets, suggesting events etc.
- Attending meetings at BES HQ twice a year (travel & accommodation covered)
- Seek to expand the SIG and promote quantitative ecology within the BES

**Policy Rep**

Do you work in policy, or do policy-focused research and consider yourself a quantitative ecologist? We are looking to take on someone to be our policy rep. The policy rep will aim to develop events (with the support of the rest of the committee) that bring together policy makers and quantitative ecologists, or that are focused around policy issues. 

**To apply**

Please send a copy of your CV, and a few sentences about what you would do in the role to [quantitative@britishecologicalsociety.org](mailto:quantitative@britishecologicalsociety.org). If you have any questions at all, do not hesitate to get in touch.

We have migrated from our old [Wordpress site](https://besquantitativeecology.wordpress.com/) in order to keep everything in one place. Our Wordpress site will function as an archive, but new material will be updated here. 

Our aim as a group is to: 

- Support quantitative skills development for all ecologists
- Improve dissemination of new quantitative methods to their users
- Provide a forum to advance quantitative ecology in its own right

If you have ideas for events, workshops or courses that you would like to see us organise (or would like to organise yourself with our support), please [contact us](/#contact).

There are few areas of modern ecology that do not rely heavily on quantitative methods! Ecological modelling and data management are rapidly expanding sub-disciplines of ecology, and so the group helps its members obtain advice, learn, apply good practice and collaborate.

We run regular training and scientific events, an event at the BES Annual Meeting and host a community-contributed set of [guides for quantitative methods](http://qedoc.wikidot.com)  â€“ feel free to share your input!

We aim to: 

- Support quantitative skills development for all ecologists
- Improve dissemination of new quantitative methods to their users
- Provide a forum to advance quantitative ecology in its own right

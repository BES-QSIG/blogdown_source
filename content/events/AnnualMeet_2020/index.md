Join the BES Quantitative Ecology SIG for their 3rd Annual Meeting, and first virtual meeting. There will be 4 sessions across the week, and each will have a keynote, 5-minute lightning talks, and a discussion around the session’s theme. There will also be a “coffee” break in each session to give you the chance to talk to other delegates, and there will be some networking activities, including a quiz on the Wednesday evening (BST).

The aim of the Quantitative Ecology SIG is threefold:

* Support quantitative skills development for all ecologists
* Improve dissemination of new quantitative methods to their users
* Provide a forum to advance quantitative ecology in its own right

This event is for any ecologist who wants to share new quantitative methods, or original research using quantitative methods; who wants to broaden their understanding of quantitative ecology; or who wants to join the discussion around how we can move quantitative ecology forward.
